<h2>1 Levels</h2>
<p>1.1</p>
<p>Gamer: As a <strong><em>gamer</em></strong> I want all the elements such as soundtrack, visuals, mechanics, etc. to incorporate the style and story of the game in order to make the game very immersive, fun, and puzzling and make the player want to continue playing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elaboration: Users should be intrigued by the gameplay and storyline enough to continue playing and reach the end of the game. If captivating enough, some players would even replay the game after beating it once.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Constraints:Developing a captivating story with complimenting visuals, soundtrack, and mechanics in the given time scope is a bit of a challenge. Also group size is a constraint as we must assign people to work on other areas such as art, soundtrack, programming, level/puzzle design; with larger groups we could focus on every aspect a gamer wants.</p>
<p>Effort Estimation: ~70 hours</p>
<p>Acceptance Test: Test the game with about 20-30 gamers, afterwards ask them to fill a quick survey going over the game as a whole:</p>
<p>Was it fun? Was it challenging? Would you play it again? Was it boring? Was it too easy? Rate the art, music, mechanics, storyline, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.2</p>
<p>Noob: As a <strong><em>noob </em></strong>I want to have an in-game tutorial so that I can easily understand how to play the game.</p>
<p>Elaboration: Users should be able to learn how to play the game, so an in-game tutorial is necessary to ensure that new players understand what to do.</p>
<p>Constraints: none</p>
<p>Effort Estimation: 3 person hours</p>
<p>Acceptance Test: Do a run-through of the tutorial on the demo to ensure it is working properly.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>1.3</p>
<p>SpeedRunner: As a <strong><em>speedrunner</em></strong>, I want a linear experience that remains predictable and unchanged every time I play the game so that I do not have to worry about random events ruining my speedruns.</p>
<p>Elaboration: The user wishes for an unbroken game. This means all potential bugs, softlocks, and random clipping errors must be patched.</p>
<p>Constraints: None.</p>
<p>Effort Estimation: 10 person-hours.</p>
<p>Acceptance Test: Complete the entire game while testing all boundaries, UI navigation, and level manipulation to check for clipping, bugs, and softlocks respectively.</p>
<p>1.4</p>
<p>Critic: As a <strong><em>critic </em></strong>I want to complete challenging tasks in the game so that I can find the game more engaging and worthy of giving a higher review.</p>
<p>Elaboration: The user wants to have a game with complex and engaging puzzles. Making our puzzles more complex will take more time in both design and implementation.</p>
<p>Constraints: Puzzles must fit within the allowed mechanics and capabilities of the game.</p>
<p>Effort Estimation: 10 person hours</p>
<p>Acceptance Test: Complete a run-through of the puzzles with focus groups to determine</p>
<p>if they find the puzzles sufficiently challenging.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>1.5</p>
<p>Prof. Z: As a <strong><em>professor </em></strong>I/we want to see challenging yet well done designs so thatI can see the creators have a good understanding of Unity and learn how to collaborate with their teammates .</p>
<p>Elaboration: The user wants to see good design. The game should look nice, it should play nice, and it should be interesting. It should be well polished, and it should look like a group effort, no one person coding everything.</p>
<p>Constraints: The game does have to be simple enough for our beginner Unity team. We have to use git.</p>
<p>Effort Estimation: 24 hours (3 hours a week for the rest of the semester)</p>
<p>Acceptance Test: Game will be demonstrated to class. Professor will provide a grade.</p>
<h2>2 music</h2>
<p>2.1</p>
<p>Musician: As a <strong><em>musician</em></strong>, I want to explore and compose the OST of the game through its gameplay mechanics so that I can experience the feeling of placing my own personal touch on the game itself.</p>
<p>Elaboration: The user wants to feel like he/she is part of the game development process (specifically, the score). Allowing the user to play each instrument line of a simple, catchy OST in game may grant a more engaging experience.</p>
<p>Constraints: OST must fit the city theme of the game, plus must be simple enough to be &ldquo;played&rdquo; on in-game instruments.</p>
<p>Effort Estimation: 15 person-hours.</p>
<p>Acceptance Test: Allow several test subjects to play the game through and record their remarks on the simplicity and &ldquo;catchiness&rdquo; of the OST.</p>
<h2>3 visuals</h2>
<p>3.1&nbsp;</p>
<p>Artist: As an <strong><em>artist</em></strong>, I want to see an aesthetically pleasing setting and interface so that I feel welcome and comfortable when visually exploring the game&rsquo;s world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elaboration: Oftentimes, the visuals and graphics are what appear most prevalently in people&rsquo;s minds when they think about a game. By having a likeable art direction and easy to use interface, players will easily be able to navigate the game and commit its larger parts to memory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Constraints: Art takes time, even something as simple as 8-bit designs can take a while to put together, particularly for backgrounds and items. Even if the game is 100% functional, there&rsquo;s no guarantee the artistic desires have enough time to be fulfilled all the way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Effort Estimation: 30+ person hours</p>
<p>Acceptance Test: Let players get accustomed to the UI, seeing if they stumble to find where certain buttons and things are. Then, ask them if they enjoyed the visuals after having them play it for a bit.&nbsp;</p>
