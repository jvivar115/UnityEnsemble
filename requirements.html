<p>User uses the Keyboard input to control the main character sprite, who will then interact with different objects; these objects could be pushable/pullable boxes, sheet music, or instruments. Most of these objects will only be accessible once the user manipulates different objects in certain ways; for example, moving the boxes will allow the user to pick up the sheet music objects, which in turn will unlock the ability to manipulate the OST via instruments.</p>

<p>The product will function as a top-down, 2D puzzle game that incorporates musical elements into gameplay by utilizing multiple inputs and user interfaces.The game will incorporate multiple levels.
